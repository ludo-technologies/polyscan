All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The hint that `jscan check` prints now points to `polyscan check`. The command still exits 2 and is not forwarded, because `polyscan check` takes different flags

## [0.11.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Require `polyscan >= 0.2.0`, the first polyscan release that analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript. 0.11.0 resolved polyscan 0.1.0, which supports only Go, Rust and C++, so `npx jscan analyze` failed with "no supported source files found"

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-03

jscan has merged into [polyscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyscan). This package is now a deprecated wrapper that prints a notice and runs the polyscan CLI. The changes listed below under 0.11.0 ship in polyscan 0.2.0.

### Changed

- `jscan analyze` forwards to `polyscan analyze`, translating `--json`, `--text` and `--html` to `--format`. `--config` exits with a hint, because polyscan discovers the configuration file itself
- `jscan check`, `jscan deps` and `jscan init` are retired and exit 2 with a migration hint. Gate on the JSON output in CI, use `polyscan analyze --select deps`, and write `jscan.config.json` by hand
- The documentation site moved to https://polyscan.codescan.dev/

### Added

- Report `complexity.summary.complexity_distribution` in the JSON and YAML output, counting the analyzed functions that have each cyclomatic complexity. The field was declared but never populated. Like every other aggregate in that summary it describes the complete analyzed population, so it is the one field that lets a consumer plot the distribution a filtered report was scored on

### Changed

- Redesign the analyze HTML report. The Overview now opens with a verdict that names which dimensions are clean and which hold the debt, a score card per dimension that links to its detail tab, a hotspot-file table joining complexity, dead code, and clones per file, and a complexity histogram that covers every analyzed function and whose buckets follow the thresholds the run was configured with. The seven tabs merge into five (Overview, Functions, Duplication, Classes, Architecture), each tab carrying a badge with the number of problems it holds. Files that could not be parsed are reported in the header and in the verdict, the Architecture tab gains the main-sequence zones and the longest dependency chains, the per-module and per-directory tables became sortable, the dead-code table announces the rows it truncates instead of hiding them silently, the report follows the display's light or dark theme, and an unrecognized URL fragment leaves the Overview open instead of blanking every panel. The report markup moved out of the Go string constant into embedded `report.html`, `report.css`, and `report.js`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Support `yaml` and `csv` output formats in `jscan analyze --format`, directing clean structured output to stdout and the score summary to stderr
- Report a project scale line (Micro, Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise, classified by analyzed file count) directly below the health score in the terminal summary, the text output, and the HTML report header. The `summary` object of the JSON and YAML output gains `project_scale` and `total_loc`. The scale is contextual only and does not affect the health score
- Apply `analysis.include_patterns`, `analysis.recursive`, `complexity.report_unchanged`, `dead_code.min_severity`, `dead_code.sort_by`, and `output.sort_by`, which until now were validated and then ignored. Include patterns select from the file types jscan can parse, using the same matching rules as `exclude_patterns`; a file named directly on the command line is analyzed whether or not it matches
- Warn on stderr, naming each key, when a configuration file sets keys that no command reads. Misspelled keys are reported the same way
- Report directory complexity rollups. The complexity section of the JSON, YAML, and CSV output gains a `by_directory` array with the function count, average and maximum complexity, high-risk count, and average and maximum nesting depth of each directory, and the text output and the HTML complexity tab gain a matching table. Directory paths are relative to the deepest directory that contains every analyzed file
- Report per-module quality hotspots. The analyze JSON and YAML output gains a `module_quality` array joining, per file, its line count, complexity rollups, and dead-code rollups, with the module name from dependency analysis; the text output, the CSV output, and a new Modules tab in the HTML report show the same table. The rollups are taken before `min_complexity` and `min_severity` are applied, so a filtered report still reports what each module carries
- Report the files that could not be read or parsed. `ComplexitySummary` gains `total_files` and `skipped_files`, and the CLI summary, the text report, and the HTML report state the shortfall and name the files

### Changed

- Fail `jscan check` when a file cannot be read or parsed, exiting 2 as its convention documents, and charge the health score a penalty proportional to the unanalyzed fraction, floored so that one skipped file forfeits an A and a wholly unparseable target cannot rank above F. A syntactically broken file used to be dropped from the analysis entirely and cleared every threshold by contributing nothing, so corrupting a module read as the largest quality improvement in a run. The parser now rejects a tree carrying ERROR or MISSING nodes, `--allow-parse-errors` keeps the previous report-only behavior, and an unknown flag or a misspelled `--select` value exits 2 instead of exiting 1 and reading as a quality verdict
- Rank the longest dependency chains across the whole graph rather than one chain per start node, so ties resolve by module name instead of traversal order, and cancel chain analysis as soon as the request context is cancelled

- Read and parse each file once into a shared project snapshot instead of once per analysis, and build each file's control flow graphs once for complexity and dead code together. A full `jscan analyze` run held five sets of parse trees at its peak and now holds one: on vuejs/core (147k lines, 474 files) peak memory drops from 1.86 GB to 1.05 GB and the parse-bound analyses (complexity, deadcode, cbo, deps) run in roughly half their previous time. A run selecting a single analysis skips the shared snapshot and keeps releasing each file as it goes, so `--select complexity` and CI `check` runs stay at their previous low peaks. Analysis results are unchanged except for the dependency-analysis fix below
- Adopt `core/clone` for grouping strategies, group dedup, Type-1/2 similarity gates, pair classification, and AST feature extraction; keep JS/TS adapters (fragment extraction, comment stripping, cost model, LSH orchestration)
- Generate configuration files containing only keys that change behavior, so `jscan init` no longer produces a file that is mostly inert. The default for `dead_code.min_severity` becomes `info`, which is the severity floor the analysis has always used
- Match `analysis.include_patterns` and `analysis.exclude_patterns` without regard to case, so that `**/*.ts` selects `Widget.TS` exactly as the file collector accepts it, and `*.min.js` also skips `Vendor.MIN.JS`
- Remove the unreachable `internal/reporter` package, `service/config_loader.go`, and the five `*ConfigurationLoader` interfaces in `domain` that nothing implemented, none of which any command called

### Fixed

- Reject unrecognized `--format` values in `jscan analyze` with an error naming supported formats instead of silently falling back to HTML
- Parse TypeScript with the TypeScript grammar in dependency analysis, which parsed every file with the JavaScript grammar and silently lost whatever a JS parse of a TS file drops — most visibly exports declared with TypeScript-only syntax, which made modules look unreferenced or export-free in the dependency graph. TypeScript projects will see more complete module nodes, and coupling metrics that follow from them (such as `deps_main_sequence_deviation`) can shift. The same rewiring gives dependency analysis real file names for every project, JavaScript included: dependency edges' `location.file_path` reported the placeholder `<input>` and now reports the analyzed file's path, both in `jscan analyze` and in `AnalyzeSingleFile`
- Measure the `nesting_depth` metric, which was reported as 0 for every function because the calculation was never called and, when called, counted a function's control structures instead of measuring how deeply they nest. An `else if` continues the chain its `if` opened, a `catch` clause stays at the level of its `try`, and a nested function is measured on its own
- Count one decision point per `case` label so a `switch` scores like the equivalent `if` chain instead of adding 1 no matter how many cases it has, and report the case count in the previously always-zero `switch_cases` metric. A `default` clause adds nothing, matching `else`. Switch-heavy code (reducers, dispatchers, state machines) now scores higher, so some functions cross the medium/high risk thresholds and complexity scores drop; the code did not get worse, it was under-measured. The same fix corrects a decision point that was lost when a branch sat inside a `try` block, so an `if` inside `try` now adds 1 as it does anywhere else
- Keep the braces of a `switch` body out of its parsed case list, which also stops them from appearing as empty case branches in the control flow graph
- Match `analysis.exclude_patterns` against whole path segments instead of any substring of a file's path, so the default entries `out` and `dist` no longer drop `src/routes/`, `src/layout/`, `src/checkout/`, or `src/utils/distance.ts`. Patterns containing a slash are matched against the path, with `**` spanning any number of directories, and patterns are now evaluated relative to the analyzed path so a parent directory named `build` no longer excludes an entire project. Affected projects will see more files analyzed and therefore different scores
- Compute the complexity summary and the directory rollups over the analyzed population instead of the filtered, sorted function list, so that a report filter no longer doubles as a scoring filter. Raising `--min-complexity` removed the very functions it was meant to surface from the population the health score divides by, and the score moved with it; `report_unchanged` did the same to trivial functions. `total_functions` and `functions_parsed` now describe the same population and are therefore equal, and the "N reported / M parsed" line goes out of the text and HTML output because there is nothing left to disclose
- Build dependency edges for dynamic `import()` calls, which were never detected: the AST builder left the `import` keyword as a generic node the callee match never recognized, calls sharing a start position were skipped as duplicates, and a template literal argument carried no text. A template literal with substitutions still resolves to no source, because it names no fixed module
- Measure dependency depth and the longest chains over the load-time graph, which counted dynamic `import()` edges while cycle detection excluded them, so a lazily imported module could add a layer to a depth the cycle report had already ruled out. Coupling metrics keep every edge, since a lazy import is still a runtime dependency
- Name an unresolved module from its resolved ID rather than from whichever importer the graph builder reached first, so a module several files reach through different relative specifiers keeps one name between runs
- Break ties in the coupling orderings by source location, so classes a sort key cannot separate no longer keep the input order, which varies run to run because files are analyzed concurrently. A tie at the ten-entry cutoff changed which class appeared in `most_coupled_classes` between runs on identical input
- Report the commit, build date, and builder in `jscan version` for release binaries, which reported the placeholders the version package holds for a plain `go build`

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-25

First release built from the polyscan monorepo. The analyzer is unchanged from 0.9.0; only the build and publish pipeline moved.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Ship Agent Skills (health-check, cli-analysis, refactoring, architecture-review) and a Claude Code plugin marketplace entry so AI coding agents can run jscan analyses via `uvx add-skills` or `claude plugin install`

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Change the code duplication metric from clone-group density to cloned-fragment ratio (clonedFragments/totalFragments), rescaling the 0-10% penalty band to 0-30%

### Fixed

- Populate previously-empty fragment hashes in clone output
- Prefer the highest-similarity clone type when classifying clone groups, so a strong Type-2/4 pair is no longer hidden behind weaker Type-3 transitive edges and dropped by the default type filter
- Suppress clone groups fully covered by another group's larger, comparable-or-better windows, fixing double-counted duplication from overlapping windows
- Drop clone groups left without any positive-similarity backing pair after dedup

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Overhaul clone detection accuracy (synced with pyscn): APTED correctness fixes (key-root ordering, forest-distance subtree cost, max-based similarity normalization), Type-1/Type-2 gating on textual and normalized-AST-hash similarity, recalibrated thresholds (0.85/0.75/0.70/0.65), Type-3 disabled by default, exact complete-linkage clustering, and MinLines/MinNodes defaults raised to 10/20
- Switch the duplication score metric to clone-group density (groups per 1000 lines, 0-10% penalty scale)
- Soften CBO coupling score calibration and use architecture compliance directly as the architecture score
- Recalibrate coupling zone classification (Zone of Pain / Zone of Uselessness predicates, instability thresholds 0.2/0.8 to 0.3/0.7)
- Exclude dynamic `import()` edges from circular dependency detection; load-time cycles are still reported when a static edge exists
- Report module-scope code as `<module>` instead of `__main__`

### Fixed

- Share clones per fragment so overlapping clone groups merge correctly
- Reject overlapping same-file fragment pairs and remove strict-subset clone group members
- Merge contiguous same-reason dead code findings and skip empty-statement-only blocks

### Performance

- Optimize cross-file dead code analysis with a shared import graph
