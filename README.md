**Code quality analyzers for AI agents**

Building with Cursor, Claude, or ChatGPT? polyscan performs structural analysis to keep your codebase maintainable: one command scores your whole codebase and shows what to fix first.

## Quick Start

No installation needed — one command runs the full analysis for JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust and C++:

```
npx polyscan analyze .
```

The language of each file is detected from its extension, and everything lands in one report with one health score.

### Demo Report

## What You Get

Every analyzer scores your codebase (0-100 with an A-F grade) and generates an HTML report that shows what to fix first, looking at your code from five angles:

- 🧹 **Dead code** - unreachable code you can safely delete
- 📋 **Duplicate code** - copy-pasted and structurally similar code worth merging (Type 1-4 clone detection)
- 🌀 **Complexity** - functions that are hard to read and test
- 🏗️ **Dependencies** - circular imports and unstable module dependencies
- 🧩 **Class design** - classes that do too much or depend on too much (CBO coupling, LCOM cohesion)

**Built with Go + tree-sitter** — fast enough to run on every commit.

## Language Support

| Language | Extensions | Complexity | Duplicate code | Dead code | Dependencies | Class design | Tool |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `.js` `.jsx` `.mjs` `.cjs` `.ts` `.tsx` `.mts` `.cts` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ CBO | `polyscan` |
| Python | `.py` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ CBO, LCOM | `pyscn` |
| Go | `.go` | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ CBO, LCOM | `polyscan` |
| Rust | `.rs` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | ✅ CBO, LCOM | `polyscan` |
| C++ | `.cpp` `.cc` `.cxx` `.hpp` `.hh` `.hxx` `.h` `.ipp` `.inl` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | `polyscan` |

Complexity and duplicate code cover every language. Dependencies cover Go, JavaScript/TypeScript and Python: for Go the nodes are packages, resolved through `go.mod`. Class design covers coupling (CBO) for Go, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript and Python and cohesion (LCOM4) for Python, Go and Rust. For Go and Rust, coupling counts the types of the analyzed tree that a type refers to from its declaration and methods, so the standard library and other modules do not count; a Go type is measured over the methods of its package, a Rust type over the methods of its `impl` blocks in a file. Dead code needs the file-level import graph that only the JavaScript/TypeScript and Python backends build today. A dimension a language does not have is left out of its score rather than counted as clean, so scores stay comparable across languages.

## Polyscan for GitHub

[Polyscan App](https://codescan.dev/pyscn-bot) files a weekly audit report as a GitHub Issue. Free for every repository.

<a href="https://codescan.dev/pyscn-bot"><img alt="Install Polyscan App for free" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Polyscan_App-Install_for_free-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white" height="44"></a>

## AI Agent Integration

The analyzers ship Agent Skills that teach AI coding agents when and how to run each analysis: health checks, refactoring, architecture review, and CI-friendly reports.

```bash
# polyscan Skills
npx skills add ludo-technologies/polyscan

# pyscn Skills
uvx add-skills ludo-technologies/pyscn
```

They work with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other agents.

Then just ask your agent:

1. "Analyze the code quality of the src/ directory"

2. "Find duplicate code and help me refactor it"

3. "Show me complex code and help me simplify it"

**Claude Code plugin marketplace:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ludo-technologies/polyscan
claude plugin install polyscan@polyscan-marketplace
```

## How It's Built

All analyzers share [`core/`](core/), a standalone, language-agnostic Go module: APTED tree edit distance, LSH/MinHash clone indexing, CFG analysis, dead code detection, and coupling/cohesion metrics. Language-specific behavior is injected via interfaces, so a new analyzer only implements parsing and classification.

```bash
go get github.com/ludo-technologies/polyscan/core
```

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`core/`](core/) | Language-agnostic analysis algorithms as a standalone Go module |
| [`polyscan/`](polyscan/) | The polyscan CLI: multi-language analysis with the JavaScript/TypeScript backend that began as jscan |
| [`jscan/`](jscan/) | The deprecated `jscan` npm wrapper and jscan's historical docs |
| [`website/`](website/) | Source of the polyscan documentation site |

jscan moved here from its former standalone repository, [ludo-technologies/jscan](https://github.com/ludo-technologies/jscan), and has since merged into the polyscan CLI; the [`jscan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscan) npm package remains published as a deprecated wrapper that runs polyscan. [pyscn](https://github.com/ludo-technologies/pyscn) remains an independent repository and consumes `core/` as a Go module dependency.

Each module is tagged with a directory prefix, e.g. `core/v0.2.1`, `polyscan/v0.1.0`.
