	// Grammar is the tree-sitter grammar the queries are written against.
	Grammar *sitter.Language
	// Definitions is a tree-sitter query that matches every function once.
	// Its @definition.<kind> capture spans the whole function and @name its
	// name. An optional @receiver capture holds a receiver type declared on
	// the function itself, as Go methods do, and is prefixed to the name
	// with the ScopeSeparator. An optional @self capture holds the receiver
	// parameter of a method that has one.
	Definitions string
	// Scopes is an optional tree-sitter query for the named scopes that
	// enclose functions, such as classes, impl blocks and namespaces:
	// @scope spans the scope and @receiver or @module holds its name. A
	// function is named after the scopes that contain it, outermost first,
	// so a member defined inside its class and one defined outside it with a
	// qualified name read the same. A @receiver scope is a type whose
	// functions are its methods; a @module scope only qualifies names.
	Scopes string
	// ScopeSeparator joins scope and receiver names to function names;
	// empty means ".".
	ScopeSeparator string
	// Decisions is a tree-sitter query in which every capture is one
	// decision point. The point is attributed to the innermost function
	// that contains it and counted under the capture's name, so the capture
	// names double as the breakdown reported next to the complexity.
	Decisions string
	// Members is an optional tree-sitter query for what a method does with
	// its own type: @field captures the name of a field it reads or writes
	// and @call the name of a sibling method it calls. A match may also
	// capture @object, the variable the access goes through, and then only
	// counts when that variable is the method's receiver, as Go's named
	// receivers require; a language whose receiver is a keyword, as Rust's
	// self is, leaves @object out. The Definitions query marks the receiver
	// with @self: a function with a receiver type but no @self, such as a
	// Rust associated function, is a method that cannot touch instance
	// state and is left out of cohesion. A language without a Members
	// query has no cohesion analysis.
	Members string
	// Bindings is an optional tree-sitter query for the local declarations
	// that can shadow the receiver a Members match goes through: @binding
	// is the declared name, @declaration the node after whose end the name
	// is in scope, as the right-hand side of a short variable declaration
	// still sees the outer name, and @scope the node at whose end it goes
	// out of scope. A Members match whose @object is shadowed at that point
	// is not an access to the receiver.
	Bindings string
	// Types is an optional tree-sitter query for the named types a file
	// declares, which the coupling (CBO) analysis measures: @name is the
	// type's name and the capture that spans the match says what it is,
	// @type a concrete declaration, @abstract an interface or trait, @impl a
	// block that adds to a type without declaring it, as a Rust impl does. A
	// language without a Types query has no coupling analysis.
	Types string
	// References is an optional tree-sitter query, paired with Types, for
	// the places a type is referred to: @reference is the name node, and an
	// optional @package the qualifier it is reached through, as in Go's
	// pkg.T. A match may capture @embedded instead of @reference for an
	// embedded field or interface or an implemented trait, which is
	// inheritance rather than use. A reference belongs to the type whose
	// method or declaration contains it.
	References string
	// Nesting is a tree-sitter query whose captures are the constructs that
	// open a nesting level: branches, loops, switches and try blocks. A
	// capture named @continuation marks a construct that continues the
	// level its parent opened rather than deepening it, as an if in the
	// else arm of another if does. A function's nesting depth is the
	// longest chain of these constructs inside it, with the function body
	// at depth 0. Code inside a function that is extracted on its own
	// belongs to that function; code inside a closure that is not counts
	// toward the enclosing function, as its decision points do.

	// Clone names the node types clone detection prices and compares.
	Clone CloneSpec
	// TestFiles names test files: a glob matches the file name, and a
	// pattern ending in a slash names a directory anywhere on the path.
	// TestCode is an optional tree-sitter query whose captures span test
	// code inside a file, such as attribute-marked test functions or
	// modules. Both are left out of every analysis by default; when they
	// are included, they still stay out of clone detection, where the
