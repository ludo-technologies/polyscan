# polyscan

A multi-language code quality analyzer. It detects the language of each file by its extension. Go, Rust and C++ get cyclomatic complexity and code clone detection from the generic engine, Go and Rust also class coupling (CBO) and cohesion (LCOM4), and Go package dependencies; JavaScript/TypeScript files get the full [jscan](../jscan/README.md) analysis (complexity, dead code, clones, coupling, dependencies). Every language lands in one report with one health score: each analyzed dimension is scored against what it could have charged, and a dimension a language does not have is left out of the score rather than scored as clean.

## Installation

```bash
npx polyscan analyze .
```

Or install from source, which needs Go and a C compiler because the tree-sitter grammars are compiled through cgo:

```bash
go install github.com/ludo-technologies/polyscan/polyscan/cmd/polyscan@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
# HTML report, written to polyscan-report.html and opened in the browser
polyscan analyze .

# HTML report to a chosen path, without opening the browser
polyscan analyze --no-open -o report.html .

# JSON or text report to stdout
polyscan analyze --format json src/
polyscan analyze --format text src/

# Clone detection only
polyscan analyze --select clone .

# List only functions with complexity 10 or higher; the summary still covers every function
polyscan analyze --min-complexity 10 .

# Leave a generated directory out of every analysis
polyscan analyze --exclude 'src/generated/**' .

# Analyze test files and test code too; they are left out by default
polyscan analyze --include-tests .
```

`--select` takes any of `complexity`, `deadcode`, `clone`, `cbo`, `lcom` and `deps` (default: all); `deps` exists for Go and JavaScript/TypeScript, `cbo` for Go, Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript, `lcom` for Go and Rust, `deadcode` for JavaScript/TypeScript only, and a deselected or missing dimension is left out of the health score. JavaScript/TypeScript honors a `jscan.config.json` when the project has one. The JSON output is one document for every language, with `language` on every function and clone fragment.

Version control, dependency and build output directories are not walked: any directory whose name starts with a dot, and `node_modules`, `vendor`, `target`, `build`, `dist` and `third_party`. A path named on the command line is analyzed whatever it is called. `--exclude` leaves out further files and directories, for every language and every analysis: a pattern without a slash is a glob matched against the file name and against each directory on the path, so `fixtures` drops every `fixtures` directory; a pattern with a slash is matched against the path relative to the analyzed directory, with `**` standing for any number of segments, so `src/generated/**` drops that tree. The flag takes a comma-separated list or may be repeated, and for JavaScript/TypeScript its patterns are added to the `exclude_patterns` of `jscan.config.json`.

Test files and test code are left out of every analysis unless `--include-tests` is given. For Go that is `*_test.go`; for C++ it is `*_test.*`, `*_tests.*`, `test_*.*` and `*Test.*` source files and any `test` or `tests` directory; for Rust it is `#[test]` functions, items under `#[cfg(test)]` or `#[cfg(all(test, ...))]`, `tests.rs` and `*_tests.rs` files and any `tests` directory, the conventional homes of a test module split into its own file and of Cargo's integration tests; for JavaScript/TypeScript it is `*.test.*` and `*.spec.*` files and any `__tests__` directory. With `--include-tests` the test code is analyzed for complexity and dead code, but it still stays out of clone detection, cohesion, coupling and dependency analysis: test functions share a skeleton by convention, and a test's types and imports describe the tests, not the package. A file that cannot be read is skipped and listed under `Errors`. A file with a syntax error is analyzed without the functions that contain the error, counted as partial, and listed under `Warnings`; C++ libraries hit this routinely, because a macro that opens a namespace or declares an attribute is a syntax error without the preprocessor.

## Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity is one plus the number of decision points in a function, counted the way `core/cfg` counts them on a control flow graph:

| Go construct | Decision points |
| --- | --- |
| `if`, `else if` | 1 each |
| `for` (any form) | 1 |
| `switch`, type switch, `select` | 1 per `case`, `default` excluded |
| `&&`, `\|\|` | 1 each |

| Rust construct | Decision points |
| --- | --- |
| `if`, `else if`, `if let` | 1 each |
| `for`, `while`, `while let`, `loop` | 1 each |
| `match` | 1 per arm except the last, which is the path the other arms branch away from, plus 1 per arm guard |
| `let ... else` | 1 |
| `&&`, `\|\|`, including `&&` in a let chain | 1 each |
| `?` | 1, the early return that `core/cfg` counts as an exception edge |

| C++ construct | Decision points |
| --- | --- |
| `if`, `else if` | 1 each |
| `?:` | 1 |
| `for`, range `for`, `while`, `do` | 1 each |
| `switch` | 1 per `case`, `default` excluded |
| `catch` | 1, the exception edge `core/cfg` counts |
| `&&`, `\|\|` | 1 each |

Function literals, closures and lambdas are not reported on their own. Their decision points count toward the enclosing function, so the Go numbers match gocyclo.

Risk levels use the thresholds shared by every polyscan analyzer: low up to 9, medium up to 19, high from 20.

## Clone detection

Every function of at least 10 lines of code (blank lines and comments excluded) and 20 syntax nodes is a fragment. Fragments are compared with the APTED tree edit distance over a tree of named syntax nodes, with comments dropped and identifiers, literals and operators carried in the node labels. Pairs are classified the way pyscn and jscan classify them:

| Type | Meaning | Reported when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type-1 | Exact copy apart from whitespace and comments | Similarity ≥ 0.85 and identical text |
| Type-2 | Same structure with renamed identifiers or changed literals | Similarity ≥ 0.80 and matching normalized trees |
| Type-3 | Near copy with statements added, removed or changed | Similarity ≥ 0.80 |

Pairs below 0.80 are not reported. Test code stays out of clone detection even under `--include-tests`: test functions share a skeleton by convention, and on this repository they made up 92% of the pairs.

C++ files are parsed one at a time without the preprocessor. Every branch of an `#if` is analyzed, macros are not expanded, and code whose syntax only makes sense after expansion is a syntax error: the file is reported as partial and the functions containing the error are left out. Heavily templated code is parsed on a best-effort basis. Header files, `.h` included, are analyzed as C++.

Rust macro invocations parse as token trees, so the code inside a macro call contributes tokens but no structure. Clone detection recall is lower on macro-heavy code. The bundled tree-sitter-rust grammar predates Rust 2024 edition syntax such as `unsafe extern` blocks; a file that uses it is reported as partial, which affected 0.75% of the files in a sample of 369 crates.

Pairs are merged into groups by connected components, and the groups are deduplicated by the shared `core/clone` passes. When there are more than 10,000 candidate pairs, only pairs that share a MinHash band are compared, and within a band each function is compared with at most 1,024 of the functions that follow it. Neighbours in a band are always compared, so a large set of near-identical functions still ends up in one group.

## Adding a language

A language is declarative: a tree-sitter grammar and two queries. See `internal/lang/golang/golang.go`.

- The definitions query matches each function once. `@definition.<kind>` spans the function, `@name` its name, and an optional `@receiver` is prefixed to the name. The bundled `queries/tags.scm` of a grammar is the starting point.
- In the decisions query every capture is one decision point, attributed to the innermost function that contains it and reported under the capture's name.
- The optional scopes query names the scopes that enclose functions, such as classes, impl blocks and namespaces, so members read `Type::method`; a `@receiver` capture in the definitions query names a receiver declared on the function itself, as Go methods have.
- The clone spec lists the node types of identifiers, literals and structural patterns, the cost tiers of the tree edit distance, and pairs of related node types. `TestFiles` names test files by file name glob or, with a trailing slash, by directory, and `TestCode` is a query capturing test code inside a file; both are left out of the analysis by default and, when included, still stay out of clone detection.

## Development

```bash
make test    # go test -race ./...
make lint    # go vet and gofmt
make build   # ./polyscan
```

The module depends on the published `core` tag rather than a `replace` directive, so `go install` works. A change to `core` has to be tagged before polyscan can use it.
